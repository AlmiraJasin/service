# Template creation project 

This project is React app and is meant to be used during JavaScript courses to ease creation of different but quite similar projects.

## Template structure

This is structured according to atomic react app design which basically means splitting components to atoms, molecules, organisms and templates in order to make each page creation much less complicated.

For css solution this template uses sass and yet no other major library.
