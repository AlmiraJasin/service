# Service creation project 

This project is split into two parts which are server and React app. In order to ease starting of project these two components have been pushed into one repo. 

Project is meant for JavaScript course exam. Learning purposes.

## Service structure

This is structured according to atomic react app design which basically means splitting components to atoms, molecules and organisms in order to make each page creation much less complicated.

For css solution this template uses sass and yet no other major library.

This page has user and admin interfaces, where user can only interact with home page after logging in and admin can access parts of site where new items can be created, deleted and edited (also after log in action).

## Starting Service project 

Please download repo, write "npm i" in your terminal to install all packages needed for server and react app, write "npm start" in separate terminals for server and react app. In order for it to fully function "MariaDB" tables are needed.
